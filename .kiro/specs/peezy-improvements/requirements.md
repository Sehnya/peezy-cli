# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing and improving the Peezy CLI tool. The focus is on finishing incomplete template implementations, refining the version scrubbing plugin, updating documentation, and ensuring overall project consistency and quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Template Implementations

**User Story:** As a developer using Peezy CLI, I want access to modern Next.js and Express.js templates so that I can quickly scaffold projects with these popular technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `peezy list` THEN I SHALL see "nextjs-app-router" and "express-typescript" templates listed
2. WHEN I run `peezy new nextjs-app-router my-app` THEN the system SHALL create a complete Next.js 14 project with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN I run `peezy new express-typescript my-api` THEN the system SHALL create a complete Express.js project with TypeScript, REST API structure, and proper development setup
4. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL include proper package.json, README, and development scripts
5. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL follow the same token replacement patterns as existing templates

### Requirement 2: Framework Version Checker Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the version scrubbing plugin to accurately check framework versions so that I can stay updated on the latest releases and security updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework version checker is invoked THEN it SHALL successfully check versions for React, Vue, Vite, Next.js, and other supported frameworks
2. WHEN checking npm packages THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully and provide accurate version information
3. WHEN checking PyPI packages THEN the system SHALL handle different package formats and provide consistent results
4. WHEN version checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback gracefully
5. WHEN framework versions are checked THEN the system SHALL identify breaking changes and provide migration guidance

### Requirement 3: Documentation Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer reading the documentation, I want all CLI commands and options to be accurately documented so that I can understand and use all available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the README THEN all CLI flags mentioned in tests SHALL be documented
2. WHEN new templates are added THEN they SHALL be listed in the README with proper descriptions
3. WHEN CLI commands are updated THEN the documentation SHALL reflect the current implementation
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL use valid template names and options
5. WHEN version information is displayed THEN it SHALL match the actual package.json version

### Requirement 4: Version Scrubbing Plugin Refinement

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want the version scrubbing plugin to be reliable and performant so that I can efficiently monitor version updates across my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL initialize without errors and be ready to accept requests
2. WHEN version checking is requested THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff strategies
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the output SHALL be well-formatted and include all requested information
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately without crashing the server

### Requirement 5: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new templates are added THEN they SHALL have corresponding tests validating their structure
2. WHEN framework version checker is implemented THEN it SHALL have unit tests covering success and error scenarios
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN tests SHALL validate that examples use correct template names and flags
4. WHEN the MCP server is modified THEN integration tests SHALL verify tool functionality
5. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL complete without excessive logging or noise

### Requirement 6: Project Structure and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want a well-organized codebase so that I can easily understand and extend the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new files are added THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions and directory structure
2. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL be properly organized in the templates directory
3. WHEN configuration files are modified THEN they SHALL maintain consistency with the project's standards
4. WHEN imports are used THEN they SHALL use the correct ES module syntax with .js extensions
5. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety
