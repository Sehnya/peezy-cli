# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Kiro plugin that automatically scrubs web APIs and sources to check for the latest versions of all runtimes, frameworks, and dependencies used in the Peezy CLI tool. The plugin will provide automated version monitoring, update recommendations, and integration with the CLI to ensure users always have access to current version information and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a maintainer of Peezy CLI, I want automated version monitoring so that I can stay informed about new releases and EOL dates for all supported runtimes and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin runs THEN it SHALL check for latest versions of Node.js, Python, Bun, and all major dependencies
2. WHEN new versions are detected THEN the plugin SHALL compare them against current requirements in documentation
3. IF a version discrepancy is found THEN the plugin SHALL generate a report with recommended updates
4. WHEN EOL dates are approaching THEN the plugin SHALL provide early warnings with migration timelines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using Peezy CLI, I want to receive recommendations for the latest stable versions so that I can use the most current and secure tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the CLI THEN it SHALL optionally check for version updates if enabled
2. IF newer stable versions are available THEN the CLI SHALL display helpful update recommendations
3. WHEN security advisories exist THEN the CLI SHALL warn users about vulnerable versions
4. IF breaking changes are detected THEN the CLI SHALL provide migration guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want the plugin to integrate seamlessly with my development workflow so that version monitoring happens automatically without disrupting my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN it SHALL run on configurable schedules (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. IF updates are found THEN the plugin SHALL create actionable notifications or pull requests
3. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the plugin SHALL provide machine-readable output for automation
4. IF rate limits are encountered THEN the plugin SHALL handle them gracefully with backoff strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive version tracking across all supported technologies so that I can make informed decisions about version requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking versions THEN the plugin SHALL monitor Node.js, Python, Bun, npm, pnpm, yarn, and pip
2. IF framework versions change THEN the plugin SHALL check React, Vue, Vite, Flask, FastAPI, and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN dependency updates are available THEN the plugin SHALL analyze compatibility and breaking changes
4. IF template dependencies need updates THEN the plugin SHALL suggest coordinated update strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to provide actionable insights so that I can understand the impact of version changes on my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN version updates are recommended THEN the plugin SHALL provide clear reasoning and impact analysis
2. IF breaking changes are involved THEN the plugin SHALL link to migration guides and changelogs
3. WHEN multiple update paths exist THEN the plugin SHALL recommend the safest upgrade strategy
4. IF dependencies conflict THEN the plugin SHALL suggest resolution strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Kiro plugin user, I want flexible configuration options so that I can customize the monitoring behavior for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the plugin THEN users SHALL be able to set check frequencies and notification preferences
2. IF specific technologies are not relevant THEN users SHALL be able to disable monitoring for them
3. WHEN working in different environments THEN the plugin SHALL support environment-specific configurations
4. IF custom version sources are needed THEN the plugin SHALL allow additional API endpoints to be configured
