## 📊 What Happens Next

### Automatic Process (GitHub Actions)

1. **Tests run** - Ensures code quality
2. **TypeScript builds** - Compiles to dist/
3. **Binaries build** - Creates cross-platform executables
4. **Sigstore signs** - Signs binaries for security
5. **GitHub release** - Creates release with all assets
6. **npm publishes** - Publishes to npm registry (if NPM_TOKEN is configured)

### Timeline

- **0-5 minutes**: GitHub Actions starts, tests run
- **5-10 minutes**: Binaries build for all platforms
- **10-15 minutes**: Sigstore signing completes
- **15-20 minutes**: GitHub release created
- **20-25 minutes**: npm package published

## 🔍 Monitoring the Release

### GitHub Actions

1. Go to: https://github.com/Sehnya/peezy-cli/actions
2. Watch the "Release" workflow
3. Verify all steps complete successfully

### Expected Workflow Steps

- [ ] ✅ Checkout code
- [ ] ✅ Setup Node.js
- [ ] ✅ Install dependencies
- [ ] ✅ Run tests
- [ ] ✅ Build TypeScript
- [ ] ✅ Build binaries
- [ ] ✅ Sign with Sigstore
- [ ] ✅ Create GitHub release
- [ ] ✅ Publish to npm

## 🎯 Verification After Release

### 1. Check GitHub Release

- [ ] Release created at: https://github.com/Sehnya/peezy-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- [ ] All binary assets present (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Checksums file included
- [ ] Installation script included

### 2. Check npm Package

```bash
# Check if published
npm view peezy-cli@1.0.0

# Test installation
npm install -g peezy-cli@1.0.0

# Verify version
peezy --version  # Should show 1.0.0

# Test hero template
peezy new nextjs-fullstack test-v1
```

### 3. Test Installation Methods

```bash
# Test npm installation
npm install -g peezy-cli
peezy --version

# Test universal installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sehnya/peezy-cli/main/install.sh | bash
peezy --version
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If npm Publishing Fails

The workflow has `continue-on-error: true` for npm publishing, so it won't fail the entire release.

**Manual npm publishing**:

```bash
# Ensure you're logged in
npm whoami

# Publish manually
npm publish

# Verify
npm view peezy-cli@1.0.0
```

### If GitHub Actions Fails

1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Fix any issues
3. Delete and recreate the tag:

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
# Fix issues, then recreate tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "..."
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

### ✅ Release Successful When:

- [ ] GitHub release created with all assets
- [ ] npm package published and installable
- [ ] All installation methods work
- [ ] Hero templates function correctly
- [ ] Migration system works
- [ ] Security features operational
- [ ] Cross-platform binaries work

### 📈 Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Update project README badges
