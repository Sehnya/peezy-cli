# Security Operations Guide

This guide covers security monitoring, vulnerability management, and security operations for Peezy CLI.

## 🔒 Current Security Status

### v1.0.0 Security Posture

- **Runtime Security**: ✅ No vulnerabilities affecting end users
- **Development Security**: ⚠️ 1 build-time vulnerability (no user impact)
- **Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW - Safe for production use

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Management

### Known Vulnerabilities

#### pkg - Local Privilege Escalation (GHSA-22r3-9w55-cj54)

- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Component**: `pkg` (build dependency only)
- **Impact**: Build-time only, no runtime impact
- **Status**: No fix available from upstream
- **Risk to Users**: ✅ NONE

**Why This Doesn't Affect Users:**

1. **Build-time only**: `pkg` is used only to create standalone binaries
2. **Not distributed**: `pkg` is not included in the published npm package
3. **Isolated environment**: Binary building happens in controlled CI environment
4. **No user execution**: End users never execute `pkg` directly

### CI/CD Security Handling

#### Intelligent Vulnerability Filtering

Our CI system distinguishes between different types of vulnerabilities:

```bash
✅ PASS: Only pkg vulnerability present (build-time only)
❌ FAIL: Any runtime vulnerability detected
❌ FAIL: High/Critical severity (unless only pkg)
✅ PASS: No vulnerabilities found
```

#### Security Job Behavior

1. **Run npm audit** and capture JSON output
2. **Parse vulnerabilities** and categorize them
3. **Count runtime vulnerabilities** (excluding known pkg issue)
4. **Fail only if runtime vulnerabilities** are found
5. **Generate detailed security report** for audit trails

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- **Every PR**: Security audit runs automatically
- **Every push**: Vulnerability scanning on main branch
- **Weekly**: Dependency updates and security reviews
- **Release**: Comprehensive security validation

### Manual Monitoring

```bash
# Check current security status
npm audit

# Check for high severity only
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Generate detailed report
npm audit --json > security-audit.json
```

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Issue Discovery

#### 1. Assessment

- **Severity**: Determine impact (Critical, High, Moderate, Low)
- **Scope**: Runtime vs build-time vs development-only
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are impacted
- **User impact**: How many users are affected

#### 2. Response Timeline

- **Critical**: Immediate response (within 2 hours)
- **High**: Same day response (within 8 hours)
- **Moderate**: Within 48 hours
- **Low**: Next regular release cycle

#### 3. Communication

- **Security advisory**: Create GitHub security advisory
- **User notification**: Update documentation and release notes
- **Patch release**: Create hotfix release if needed

### Example Response Process

#### For Runtime Vulnerability

1. **Immediate**: Create private security advisory
2. **Within 2 hours**: Assess impact and create fix
3. **Within 4 hours**: Test fix and prepare patch release
4. **Within 6 hours**: Release patch and notify users
5. **Within 24 hours**: Update documentation and post-mortem

#### For Build-time Vulnerability

1. **Within 48 hours**: Assess if fix is available
2. **Document**: Update security advisory with details
3. **Monitor**: Track upstream fix availability
4. **Plan**: Include fix in next regular release

## 🔧 Security Tools and Processes

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Regular dependency updates
npm outdated
npm update

# Security-focused updates
npm audit fix

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### Code Security

```bash
# TypeScript strict mode
npx tsc --noEmit --strict

# Lint for security issues
npm run lint

# Comprehensive security checks
npm run check
```

### Template Security

```bash
# Verify template signatures
peezy verify-template nextjs-fullstack

# Audit project security
peezy audit

# Check trust policies
peezy trust list
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Each Release

- [ ] Run comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Review all dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test security features (verify, audit, trust)
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Validate CI security checks

### Monthly Security Review

- [ ] Review dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions
- [ ] Audit CI/CD security configurations

### Quarterly Security Assessment

- [ ] Comprehensive security review
- [ ] Threat model updates
- [ ] Security tool evaluation
- [ ] Process improvement review
- [ ] Security training updates

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Development

- **Validate all inputs** from users and external sources
- **Use secure defaults** in all configurations
- **Minimize dependencies** to reduce attack surface
- **Regular updates** of security-related dependencies

### For Operations

- **Monitor vulnerabilities** continuously
- **Respond quickly** to security issues
- **Document everything** for audit trails
- **Test security features** regularly

### For Users

- **Keep updated** to latest versions
- **Use official sources** for installation
- **Report security issues** responsibly
- **Follow security guidelines** in documentation

## 📞 Security Contacts

### Reporting Security Issues
