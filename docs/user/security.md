# Security Advisory - Peezy CLI v1.0.0

## Overview

This document addresses security considerations for Peezy CLI v1.0.0 and provides transparency about known vulnerabilities and their impact.

## Current Security Status: ✅ SAFE FOR PRODUCTION

### Summary

- **Runtime Security**: ✅ No vulnerabilities affecting end users
- **Development Security**: ⚠️ 1 build-time vulnerability (no user impact)
- **Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW - Safe for production use

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. pkg - Local Privilege Escalation (GHSA-22r3-9w55-cj54)

- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Component**: `pkg` (build dependency)
- **Impact**: Build-time only, no runtime impact
- **Status**: No fix available from upstream
- **Risk to Users**: ✅ NONE

#### Why This Doesn't Affect Users

1. **Build-time only**: `pkg` is used only to create standalone binaries
2. **Not distributed**: `pkg` is not included in the published npm package
3. **Isolated environment**: Binary building happens in controlled CI environment
4. **No user execution**: End users never execute `pkg` directly

#### Mitigation Measures

- ✅ **Isolated build environment** - Binaries built in GitHub Actions
- ✅ **No user access** - Users don't have access to build tools
- ✅ **Alternative installation** - Users can install via npm (no `pkg` involved)
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Actively monitoring for `pkg` security updates

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### ✅ esbuild/vite Vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)

- **Status**: FIXED in v1.0.0
- **Action**: Updated vitest to v3.2.4
- **Impact**: Development server vulnerability resolved

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Dependency Management

- ✅ **Regular audits** - Automated security scanning in CI
- ✅ **Minimal dependencies** - Only essential packages included
- ✅ **Version pinning** - Exact versions specified for security
- ✅ **Separation** - Build vs runtime dependencies clearly separated

### 2. CI/CD Security

- ✅ **Intelligent scanning** - Security audits with known vulnerability filtering
- ✅ **Runtime protection** - CI fails on any runtime security vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Build-time awareness** - Known build-time vulnerabilities (pkg) don't fail builds
- ✅ **Dependency checks** - New dependencies automatically audited
- ✅ **Isolated builds** - Binary building in secure environment
- ✅ **Signed releases** - GitHub releases with checksums

### 3. Runtime Security

- ✅ **Input validation** - All user inputs validated
- ✅ **Secure defaults** - Conservative security settings
- ✅ **No network dependencies** - Templates embedded locally
- ✅ **Sandboxed execution** - No arbitrary code execution

## User Security Recommendations

### For End Users

1. **Install from npm** - Recommended installation method

   ```bash
   npm install -g peezy-cli
   ```

2. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   peezy --version  # Should show 1.0.0
   ```

3. **Use official sources**
   - npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/peezy-cli
   - GitHub: https://github.com/Sehnya/peezy-cli

### For Enterprise Users

1. **Security scanning** - Run your own security scans if required
2. **Network policies** - Peezy works offline (no network required)
3. **Audit logging** - Use `--json` flag for structured logging
4. **Version pinning** - Pin to specific versions in your environment

## Reporting Security Issues

### How to Report

- **Email**: security@peezy.dev (preferred)
- **GitHub**: Private security advisory
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours

### What to Include

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Don't post on social media or forums
- ❌ Don't attempt to exploit vulnerabilities

## Security Roadmap

### v1.0.1 (Planned)

- 🔄 **pkg replacement** - Evaluate alternatives to `pkg` for binary building
- 🔄 **Enhanced auditing** - More comprehensive security scanning
- 🔄 **Sigstore integration** - Full production Sigstore implementation

### Ongoing

- 🔄 **Regular audits** - Monthly security dependency reviews
- 🔄 **Vulnerability monitoring** - Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
- 🔄 **Security updates** - Prompt updates for any security issues

## Compliance & Standards

### Security Standards

- ✅ **OWASP Guidelines** - Following web application security practices
- ✅ **npm Security** - Adhering to npm package security best practices
- ✅ **GitHub Security** - Using GitHub security features and scanning

### Transparency

- ✅ **Public audits** - Security status documented publicly
- ✅ **Vulnerability disclosure** - Transparent about known issues
- ✅ **Regular updates** - Security status updated with each release

## Conclusion

**Peezy CLI v1.0.0 is safe for production use.** The single remaining vulnerability affects only the build process and poses no risk to end users. We maintain a strong security posture with:

- ✅ No runtime vulnerabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive security practices
- ✅ Transparent vulnerability disclosure
- ✅ Active monitoring and updates
